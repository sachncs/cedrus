"""Exception hierarchy for cedrus.

Every error raised by the library inherits from :class:`Error`,
which lets callers handle the entire family with a single ``except``
clause. More specific categories are exposed as direct subclasses so
callers can narrow their handling when needed.

Hierarchy:
    The hierarchy is organized by responsibility, not by layer:

    * :class:`Error` - base class. Catch this when you want every
      cedrus error.
    * :class:`Config` - bad configuration (CLI flags, env vars, invalid
      generator options).
    * :class:`Require` - missing or malformed requirement files.
    * :class:`Fault` - policy-level issues, plus four subclasses:
      :class:`Compile`, :class:`Validate`, :class:`Generate`,
      :class:`ScopeFault`.
    * :class:`Store` - repository-level failures such as missing records.
    * :class:`Space` - space-level invariants violated.
    * :class:`Deploy` - deployment operation failed.
    * :class:`Parse` - cedarpy could not parse a policy.

Threading and pickling:
    All exceptions are plain :class:`Exception` subclasses and are
    safe to propagate across thread boundaries. The :class:`Validate`
    adds ``errors`` and ``policy_source`` attributes for downstream
    diagnostic surfaces; other errors keep the default
    :class:`Exception` shape.

Attributes:
    Error: Base class for every error raised by cedrus.
    Config: Bad configuration.
    Require: Missing or malformed requirement file.
    Fault: Base for policy-level errors.
    Compile: Draft could not be compiled to Cedar source.
    Validate: Cedar parse or schema-validation failure.
    Generate: Generator failed to produce a proposal.
    ScopeFault: Scope object is malformed.
    Store: Repository-level failure (e.g. missing record).
    Space: Space-level invariant violation.
    Deploy: Deployment operation failed.
    Parse: cedarpy could not parse a policy.
