"""Typed wrapper for the items a generator could not safely resolve.

Encapsulates the tuple shape and provides merging / appending
operations. Replaces the ``tuple[str, ...]`` previously passed
through the generator pipeline.

    Behaves like a tuple of strings: supports ``len()``, iteration, and

    several sources. ``add`` and ``merge`` return new instances; the
