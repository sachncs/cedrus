"""Deployment automation for compiled Cedar policies.

A :class:`Bundler` produces a self-contained deployment artifact
(a Cedar source bundle plus a manifest with a SHA-256 integrity
hash). A :class:`Client` pushes the bundle to either a local
directory or a remote HTTP endpoint and records the deployment in
the workspace.

Bundle format:
    Every deployment produces a two-file artifact:

    * ``bundle.cedar`` - concatenated Cedar source for every compiled
      policy in the domain.
    * ``manifest.json`` - metadata describing the bundle: domain, the
      SHA-256 of ``bundle.cedar``, policy identifiers, creation
      timestamp, and any user-supplied metadata.

    The bundle hash in the manifest is recomputed on read; a
    mismatch or a missing manifest hash raises :class:`Deploy`. The
    hash provides **corruption detection** after transport; it is not
    an authenticated signature. To obtain tamper evidence, add a
    keyed signature (HMAC-SHA-256 with a shared key, or Ed25519 with
    a known public key) in the deploy metadata on the receiving side.

Atomicity:
    Local deployments write the bundle to a sibling temporary
    directory first, fsync both data and directory, and atomically
    rename each file into place with :meth:`pathlib.Path.replace`.
    Concurrent writers therefore never observe a mixed state where
    one file is the new version and the other is the old version. A
    crash before the rename leaves the previous bundle untouched.
    Symlink targets are refused to avoid cross-trust boundary
    replacement.

Network behavior:
    :meth:`Client.deploy_http` uses :mod:`httpx` with a custom
    transport that pins the connection to the IP address resolved at
    SSRF-check time. This closes the DNS-rebinding window in which an
    attacker controlling authoritative DNS returns a public address
    at guard time and a private address at request time. Redirects
    are disabled by default; an explicit ``follow_redirects=True``
    flag is required to follow 3xx responses (which re-enter the
    SSRF guard on each hop).

    Response bodies are read in bounded chunks so that a streaming
    or oversized endpoint cannot exhaust memory. The body is
    **never** embedded in error messages or persisted verbatim in
    deployment records; only a SHA-256 of the body is retained.
    This prevents the deployment client from leaking whatever the
    target server returns (stack traces, echoed credentials,
    internal hostnames) into stderr or the SQLite store.

    The default :class:`Guard` rejects loopback, link-local, and
    private-network targets so untrusted callers cannot use the
    deployment client as an SSRF proxy. Operators who genuinely need
    to deploy into a private network can pass
    ``allow_private_targets=True`` to the client constructor.

Attributes:
    Manifest: Self-contained deployment artifact.
    Record: Persisted record of a successful deployment.
    Bundler: Build, write, and read :class:`Manifest` objects.
    Guard: Reject requests to loopback / link-local / private targets.
    Pin: A DNS-resolved address to which an HTTP connection is pinned.
    Transport: httpx transport that pins each connection to a resolved IP.
    Client: Push a :class:`Manifest` to a local directory or HTTP endpoint.

    untrusted callers cannot use the client as an SSRF proxy. The
    guard resolves the target hostname through DNS and rejects any
    address that falls inside a reserved range.

    The guard is also responsible for **pinning** the resolved
    address. Callers should connect to the returned :class:`Pin`
    rather than re-resolving the hostname, which closes the
    DNS-rebinding window in which an attacker returns a public
    address at guard time and a private address at request time.

    Attributes:
        allow_private_targets: When ``True``, the guard permits
            addresses inside RFC1918 private ranges. Loopback and
            link-local are still rejected.
        allow_loopback: When ``True``, the guard permits loopback and
            link-local addresses. Intended for tests that bind to
            ``127.0.0.1``; never enable in production.
        resolver: Optional DNS resolver. Defaults to
            :func:`socket.getaddrinfo`. Tests inject a stub to avoid
            network calls.
