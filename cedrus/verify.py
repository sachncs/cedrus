"""Static symbolic verification for Cedar policy sets.

The :meth:`Verifier.verify` method performs a static analysis of a
domain's policy set and reports:

* **shadowing** - a ``forbid`` whose scope dominates a ``permit``,
  making the permit unreachable in practice;
* **redundancy** - two policies with equivalent scopes, the same
  effect, and the same conditions (one is implied by the other);
* **requirement coverage** - whether every loaded requirement has at
  least one compiled policy;
* **action coverage** - whether every action declared in the schema
  has at least one policy that references it, with action-group
  membership expanded;
* **entity-type coverage** - whether every entity type in the schema
  is referenced by at least one policy.

The verifier analyzes the deployed Cedar source directly rather than
the typed intent metadata, so coverage and shadowing reflect what
will actually run.

Algorithm notes:
    Scope dominance is approximated by comparing the *signature* of a
    scope: a tuple of (kind, type_name, entity_id, group_type,
    group_id) for principals, an analogous tuple for resources, and a
    tuple that includes the namespace and ``"named"``/``"in_group"``
    flag for actions. Two policies are considered to share a shadow
    or a redundancy only when their scope signatures match across
    every slot AND their condition signatures match.

    ``any`` does not subsume a non-``any`` scope: a forbid on Alice
    does not shadow a permit on ``any`` principal.

    Action coverage expands action-group membership:
    ``action in Action::"readers"`` counts as covering every member
    action of the ``readers`` group. This keeps coverage faithful to
    Cedar's authorization semantics.

    Cedar parsing uses :func:`cedarpy.policies_to_json_str` to obtain
    a structured AST rather than a regex. The verifier therefore
    cannot be tricked by comments, embedded semicolons, or syntax that
    a regex would silently misclassify. When cedarpy cannot parse a
    policy, the verifier emits a ``malformed-policy`` warning rather
    than falling back to a permissive default.

    Conditions are compared by hashing the canonical JSON form of
    their AST bodies, so ``principal == User::"alice"`` and equivalent
    reorderings produce identical signatures.

    Complexity is O(n^2) for shadowing/redundancy across n policies
    and O(n*m) for coverage across n policies and m schema entries.
    That is acceptable for typical domain sizes (dozens to low hundreds
    of policies). A full SMT-backed equivalence check via
    cedar-policy-symcc would replace these approximations when needed.

The AST parsing helpers, the coverage algorithms, and the policy
accessors are all classmethods / staticmethods of :class:`Verifier`
and :class:`Extraction`; there are no module-level free functions.
